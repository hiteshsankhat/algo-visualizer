# **Sorting Algorithms in JavaScript**

> This repository contains implementations of few popular sorting algorithms

- [x] Selection sort
- [x] Bubble sort
- [x] Insertion sort
- [x] Quick sort

## Selection Sort

> **Selection sort** algorithm sorts an array by repeatedly finding the minimum element (considering ascending order) from the unsorted part and putting it at the beginning.

## Bubble Sort

> **Bubble sort** is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly iterates through the list, compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. It repeats this process until the list is sorted.

## Insertion Sort

> **Insertion sort** is a simple sorting algorithm that works similar to the way you sort playing cards in your hands. The array is virtually split into a sorted and an unsorted part. Values from the unsorted part are picked and placed at the correct position in the sorted part.

## Quick Sort

> **Quick sort** is a divide and conquer algorithm that uses recursion to sort a list. It works by selecting a "pivot" element from the list and partitioning the other elements into two lists, according to whether they are less than or greater than the pivot. It then recursively sorts the sub-lists.
