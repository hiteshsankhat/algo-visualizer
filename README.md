## Bubble Sort

    Bubble sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly iterates through the list, compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. It repeats this process until the list is sorted.

## Quick Sort

    Quick sort is a divide and conquer algorithm that uses recursion to sort a list. It works by selecting a "pivot" element from the list and partitioning the other elements into two lists, according to whether they are less than or greater than the pivot. It then recursively sorts the sublists.
